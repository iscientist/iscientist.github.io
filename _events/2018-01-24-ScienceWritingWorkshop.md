We thank everyone who attended our first outreach workshop!

We were very excited to partner with the [Student Success Centre (SCC)](https://studentsuccess.mcmaster.ca/) to deliver a workshop on science writing. Students learned how to structure a science article, write in clear and concise language, as well as critically evaluate the effectiveness of a piece of writing.

We hope everyone had a good time and stay tuned for future workshops!
