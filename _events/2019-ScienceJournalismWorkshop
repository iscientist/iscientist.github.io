Join us Thursday, March 21st from 1:30 â€“ 2:30 pm in ThInK Space (3rd floor of Thode Library) for an informative workshop on communicating science to a public audience. This workshop will be led by Dr. Katie Moisse, a science journalist with a neuroscience background. She has had a career as a Digital Health Editor for ABC News and publications in Scientific American, Spectrum, and The Atlantic. Gain insight into how you can use your science background for a non-traditional career!
