We welcome anyone interested in how science is published to attend our upcoming peer review workshop!

What is "Peer Review" and why is it important? We have invited [Librarian Abeer Siddiqui](https://library.mcmaster.ca/contact/siddiqui-abeer) to come and teach us all about this crucial step in the publication process. By the end of the workshop, you will be able to better proofread your own writing, as well as make constructive comments on others'. Peer review is an essential part in maintaining high standards in the scientific community.
