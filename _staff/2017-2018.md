### Senior Editors

about="
Hello! I am one of the iScientist Senior editors for 2017-2018. I help assign articles for peer review, oversee the outreach workshops, and be somewhat organized occasionally.

I enjoy using equations to understand the brain, and am lucky enough that a field like computational neuroscience exists. I think science literacy is great because it helps everyone learn more about the world and make informed decisions.

subtitle='Senior Advisor'
about="
Hello! My name is James Lai, and I am currently a senior advisor for the iScientist editorial board (2016-2018). I have also previously served as Senior Editor (2015-2016). My role this year is mainly to assist the editorial board as needed and offer insight based on my prior experience on the editorial board.

My research interests include astrobiology (particularly life detection on ocean worlds such as Europa), pedagogy (especially regarding science literacy and communication), and human health. I am always looking for novel ways to find the intersections in these seemingly disparate fields, and I have a lot of enthusiasm for interdisciplinary research that can draw together different fields in unexpected ways.

### Editors

name='Tanya Daniel'
subtitle='Level III Editor'
about="
Hello! Iâ€™m the one of the two Level III Editors for The iScientist. My main responsibility is to assign peer reviewers and to critically review submitted manuscripts, mainly in the field of ecology. I also assist with logistics and promotions.

Primarily, I am passionate about urban ecology especially the development of environmentally-conscious cities to minimize habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss. I am also interested in studying the impacts of invasive organisms in these urban areas. I also like to identify Ontario bees.

My favourite aspect of effective science communication is its ability to inspire readers to explore scientific research and to ultimately encourage advocacy for influential policies.

Hey everyone! I'm one of the two Level II editors on the editorial board for this year. My job in the iScientist is to make sure all of your submissions go through a thorough and fair peer review and editorial process!

Personally, my interests lie in biology, range from neuroscience to invasion ecology. I don't really know where I'm headed in the future, but for now I'm trying to focus my studies in those areas! I'm also really interested in the mainstream communication of science, and how we could get more people to read scientific literature!

subtitle='Promotions Manager'
about="
Hi there! I'm the iScientist promotions manager and webmaster for 2017-2018. I design the posters used for promotions and events, as well keep the website up to date. My main goal this year was creating the modern and feature-rich webpage you are currently on, so that the journal can have a friendlier face on the internet.

I myself am mostly interested in research at the confluence of computer science, physics, and applied mathematics. I like looking at methods for more accurately and efficiently simulating fluids of different kinds!

My favourite part of science communication is trying to find different creative avenues for which we tell science like interactive computer programs, workshops, movies, *etc.*
