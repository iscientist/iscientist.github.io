Hi there! I\'m the iScientist promotions manager and webmaster for 2017-2018. My main goal this year was creating the modern and feature-rich webpage you are currently on, so that the journal can have a friendlier face on the internet.

I myself am mostly interested in research at the confluence of computer science, physics, and applied mathematics. I am hoping to build a research career looking at methods for more accurately and efficiently simulating fluids of different kinds.

Come visit me on my [personal website: jpanuelos.com](http://jpanuelos.com).
