about='
Hello! My name is James Lai, and I am currently a senior advisor for the iScientist editorial board (2016-2018). I have also previously served as Senior Editor (2015-2016). My role this year is mainly to assist the editorial board as needed and offer insight based on my prior experience on the editorial board.

My research interests include astrobiology (particularly life detection on ocean worlds such as Europa), pedagogy (especially regarding science literacy and communication), and human health. I am always looking for novel ways to find the intersections in these seemingly disparate fields, and I have a lot of enthusiasm for interdisciplinary research that can draw together different fields in unexpected ways.
