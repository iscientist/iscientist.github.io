  Pharmaceutical soil contamination has become a rising concern based on its potential impacts on ecological interactions. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), also known as Aspirin, is a commonly used medication that has been found to have an impact on plant defence by enhancing salicylic acid immunity pathways. This study aimed to determine the impact of varying ASA soil concentrations on the population growth of *Myzus persicae* on genotypically different strains of *Arabidopsis thaliana*. Additionally, this study analyzed how varying ASA soil concentrations impact the plant growth of *A. thaliana*. Two ascension lines of *A. thaliana* were used in this experiment: the wild-type *Col* line and the mutant salicylic acid induction-deficient *sid2*. Each plant was treated with one of four aqueous ASA concentrations (0M, 1.1nM, 11nM, 0.2mM). Overall, *sid2* plants experienced a negative mean aphid population growth rate relative to the *Col* plants. It was concluded that neither genotype nor ASA concentration had a significant impact on the population growth of *M. persicae*. Interactions between genotype and ASA concentrations were found to be significant for both aphid population and bolt height responses. A greater reduction in aphid population was observed as ASA concentration was increased for both genotypes, while an inverse relationship was observed between ASA concentration and bolt height growth. There were no observable effects of bolt height on *M. persicae* population growth. Overall, investigating the interactions between *M. persicae* and *A. thaliana* in the presence of acetylsalicylic acid provides further evidence for the ecological impact of pharmaceuticals, and the importance of minimizing this contamination.
