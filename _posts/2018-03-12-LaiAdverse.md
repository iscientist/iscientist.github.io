  Monosodium glutamate (MSG) is a widely used flavour enhancer, first patented as a food additive in 1908. Although the compound has been recognized as safe for human consumption by regulatory bodies, there exist medical and anecdotal reports and beliefs that consuming MSG can elicit a variety of adverse effects. In this work, the known biologic effects of glutamate, the active compound in MSG, are first briefly discussed, followed by a summary of existing literature on adverse effects of human consumption of MSG. Overall, based on the current state of evidence, it is argued in this work that although the constellation of symptoms, now referred to as MSG symptom complex, have not reliably been reproduced in controlled study conditions and are thus often dismissed, some evidence points to possible effects of MSG on human physiology; gaps in the literature persist that warrant further study, such as better controlled studies involving MSG consumption with food.
