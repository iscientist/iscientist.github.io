  Used motor oil (UMO) is a highly toxic substance that enters the environment as runoff from roadways and other urbanized impermeable surfaces. The effects of various runoff contaminants on the environment have been studied extensively, with research focusing on efficient and effective methods of clean-up. This study serves to examine the effects of varying volumes of UMO on plants and the subsequent impacts on herbivores. *Arabidopsis thaliana* was used as the model plant organism due to its rapid life cycle and *Myzus persicae* was used as the model herbivore organism due to its high proliferation rate. The results showed a statistically significant effect (Foil(3,64)=3.3853, P=0.023) of UMO treatment on plant performance. There was also a statistically significant effect (F21, 256=2.4661, P=0.00052) due to the interaction of oil and day on the herbivore of the plant. The results indicate that contaminants can affect multiple trophic levels, which should be considered when looking at possible issues regarding the contamination of natural environments.
