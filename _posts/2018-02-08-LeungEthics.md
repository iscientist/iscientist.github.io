  Research that contributes to significant advancements in healthcare is often achieved through the analysis of data from human participants. Many researchers in this field seek a diverse group of participants to study the effects of new drug treatments, diets, or other related therapies. Clinical trials and studies involving human participants are important for the progression of science, but require extensive ethical consideration. Ethics are the moral principles that govern a behaviour or activity, in this case, performing tests on humans. The understanding of ethical regulations outlines the key responsibilities of the investigator, and more importantly, ensures the protection of the participant’s rights. This historical review examines the controversies that led to the development of ethical guidelines for human participation in research since the 1940s. It is through various major controversies that the documents containing these guidelines have continuously been shaped and edited. Analyzing the development of the Nuremberg Code, the Declaration of Helsinki, and the Belmont Report contributes to a stronger understanding of current regulations and modern ethical controversies. These documents carefully considered the issues in their predecessors and include key points that aim to protect the rights of those who participate in research.
