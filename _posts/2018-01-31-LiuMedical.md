  Antibiotics have saved millions of lives but the rapid development of antibiotic resistant bacteria is inevitably becoming the most dangerous public health threat. These miracle drugs are widely used in agriculture, medicine and common everyday products; however, the overuse of antibiotics is correlated with the development of drug resistance. This growing medical concern invokes fear in the public as it eliminates the ability to effectively treat infectious diseases. Starting from the serendipitous discovery of penicillin in 1928, scientific advancements and government policies have led to controversies between scientists and industries on the use of antibiotics as the development of resistance has accelerated. This review discusses significant events, people and causes involved and identifies the time in history when antibiotic resistance became a serious public health problem.
