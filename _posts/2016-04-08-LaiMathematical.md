  The habitable zone is the range of orbital radii at which celestial body’s temperature is conducive to liquid water. The ability to predict exoplanetary habitability allows for understanding of the range of orbital parametersin which life as we know it may arise and survive. In this paper, elements of mathematical models in the literature developed to determine energy contributions by stellar radiation and tidal heating were combined, producing a Maple 18 model accounting for both circumstellar and circumplanetary habitability. Using input star, planet, and moon properties, the model outputs calculated temperatures for both the planet and moon, as well as coloured maps representing the habitable zone. Using this model, the effect on the habitable zone when tidal heating is considered in addition to stellar radiation was assessed, giving a better understanding of how these factors influence habitability. Specifically, tidal heating pushes both edges of the habitable zone outward, but overall, tends to decrease the size of the habitable zone. However, accounting for the circumplanetary habitable zonein addition to the circumstellar habitable zone expands the overall habitable zone. By synthesizing a single model from existing literature models, a more accurate prediction of exoplanetary system habitability may be obtained, allowing scientists to better determine which exoplanets are more likely to have life and target these for further study. Therefore, the model was applied to existing exoplanet data to demonstrate this application of the model in predicting exoplanet and exomoon temperatures.

## Introduction

The relatively new field of astrobiology is concerned with the origins, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe (National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2014a). An important aspect of this field is understanding the range of conditions under which life as we know it can develop and exist (Des Marais, et al., 2008). One condition often considered is the presence of liquid water: for life as we know it, water is the universal solvent, and its polar nature grants it many properties that are useful to life (Mottl, et al., 2007). Thus, the "habitable zone" around a star is often defined as the set of orbital radii around a star that allows liquid water to exist on a celestial body (Doyle, Billingham and DeVincenzi, 1998). Traditionally, most calculations of habitable zones have only considered the amount of energy received by a planet due to its star's illumination: while this is a major component for assessing habitability, other factors are also involved (Kaltenegger and Segura, 2011). One of the most intriguing of these additional factors is tidal heating. Tidal heating is the heat generated by the flexing of a celestial body's surface due to the gravitational forces exerted by an orbiting body. While the heat generated by the moon's tidal heating of the Earth's oceans is negligible compared to the incoming stellar radiation, tidal heating is considered a major source of energy for celestial bodies like Jupiter’s moon Europa (Patiño Douce, 2011). Tidal heating by Jupiter's gravity delivers 6TW of power to Europa, which is enough to generate what is believed to be a subsurface liquid water ocean on Europa (Greenberg, 2007).

In this paper, I produce a model that takes into account both solar illumination and tidal heating as a sources of heat for a celestial body. This model considers both planets and moons together, whereas previous studies have generally considered one or the other in isolation. Thus, this paper works to combines previous work including Heller and Barnes (2013), who consider exomoons alone, and Jackson, Barnes and Greenberg (2008), who examine only tidal heating of planets.

### Factors Affecting Habitability

In this work, the habitable zone refers to the set of regions in space around a star in which a celestial body receives enough heat energy for liquid water to exist. Thus, factors affecting habitability are the various sources of heat that a celestial body may have.

As noted above, stellar illumination is one of the greatest factors and is most commonly used to calculate habitable zones. Another factor affecting the amount of heat energy a celestial body receives is its atmosphere. The atmosphere may reflect some of the incoming stellar radiation, for example, due to clouds. This, combined with the light reflected by the body’s surface, is quantified as the albedo. However, the atmosphere can also help the planet retain the heat it absorbs through the greenhouse effect (Kaltenegger and Segura, 2011).

Besides the factors involving stellar radiation (stellar illumination, albedo, and the greenhouse effect), tidal heating is another factor that can affect habitability. Tidal heating occurs due to the flexing of a celestial body's surface caused by gravitational attraction by an orbiting body. This heating can occur through multiple mechanisms. When the orbiting bodies are not tidally locked (they do not rotate at the same speed and so do not always present the same face to one another), the tidal bulge raised on one body by the other rotates away as the first body rotates. This causes the bulge to "travel" across the surface in order to continue facing the other body; the required deformation of material causes the release of heat. However, tidal heating can also occur for tidally locked systems. When one body is tidally locked to another, the same face is always facing the other body. Thus, the bulge does not travel across the surface and no tidal heat is generated through the first mechanism. However, if the tidally locked body's orbit is eccentric, then at different points in its orbit, it will be at different distances to the second body. This means it will experience varying levels of the gravitational force over its orbit, so the tidal bulge will change in height at different points in the orbit. Again, this change in height requires the deformation of material, so heat is released in the process (Patiño Douce, 2011). Another tidally-­‐ induced form of heating involves Rossby waves, which are oceanic waves with long wavelength and low amplitude that can transfer energy over distances (Tyler, 2008).

In addition, a celestial body can also gain heat from other sources. For example, heat can be released by the radioactive decay of radionuclides in a body’s interior (Frank, Meyer and Mojzsis, 2014). As well, there are various types of heat associated with planetary formation including heat from accretion, gravitational compression, and core formation (Horedt, 1980).

## Materials and Methods

### Factors Considered in the Model

While it would be ideal to consider all the factors described previously, this is not feasible due to the dependence of many of these factors on parameters for which data is not widely available. Thus, this model considers only stellar radiation and tidal heating. While the greenhouse effect plays a major role on planets with substantial atmospheres, it is difficult to model atmospheric effects, so this factor is neglected. Furthermore, calculations of radiogenic and primordial heat require knowledge of the physical composition of celestial bodies, and exact quantitative data on this is not easily accessible, especially for exoplanets and exomoons.

Tidal heating, as noted above, consists of various different components. Attempts were made to include all components discussed, but the mathematics behind Rossby waves were too complex to incorporate in the available timeframe. Additionally, they require the assumption of a fluid covering the surface of the celestial body, an assumption that would be in contrast to other assumptions made while calculating the other components of tidal heating, namely, the assumption of a solid, Earth-­‐like surface (see the Assumptions section below).

### Mathematical Equations for the Factors

An equation quantifying the amount of heat contributed by a particular factor is necessary in order to be able to incorporate that factor into the mathematical model. In order to describe the amount of energy received by a celestial body per unit time (power), we use the equation

$$
\pi{}R_{Planet}^2(1-A)F_a = 4\pi{}R_{Planet}^{2}\sigma{}T_{Planet}^{4}
$$

where $$A$$ is the (unitless) albedo of the planet, $$F_a$$ is the flux at the given orbital radius $$a$$ in $$W/m^2$$, $$R$$ is the radius of the planet (or moon), $$σ$$ is the Stefan-­‐ Boltzmann constant, and $$T$$ is the temperature of the celestial body in Kelvin — the value being solved for (Seager, 2010). The equation can be understood in physical terms as describing the celestial body in a state of thermal equilibrium where the incoming heat (left side) is balanced by the heat being lost (right side). On the left side, the incoming flux is $$F_a$$. This is multiplied by the area of the celestial body facing the star, which appears as a disc and is therefore represented by $$πR2$$. This value can then be multiplied by the $$(1-­A)$$ term to account for incoming energy that is not absorbed due to albedo. On the left side, the entire surface of the celestial body is assumed to radiate heat equally, so the full surface area of a sphere, $$4πR^2$$, is used. This is multiplied by $$σT^4$$, which is equal to the flux leaving the planet (as stated by the Stefan-­‐Boltzmann law).

To calculate the stellar flux at a given distance, a second formula is required:

$$
F(a) = R_{Star}^2\sigma{}T_{Star}^{4}/a^{2}
$$

where $$RStar$$ is the radius of the star, $$T_{Star}$$ is the temperature of the star, $$a$$ is the semi­‐major axis length in meters, and $$F$$ is the flux as a function of the semi-­major axis length, in $$W/m^2$$ (Seager, 2010). This formula can be interpreted as an expression of the conservation of energy: a star radiates $$4\pi{}R_{star}^2\sigma{}T_{Star}^4$$ of power (surface area $$4\pi{}R_{Star}^2$$ multiplied by flux $$\sigma{}T_{Star}^4$$), which is conserved as it moves to greater radii, so the same amount of energy is spread out over a larger surface area, $$4\pi{}a^2$$. The $$4π$$ cancels out, and the above expression is obtained. This equation also works for stellar radiation falling on a moon if $$R_{Moon}$$ and $$T_{Moon}$$ are used instead.

There are many different formulae used to calculate the tidal heat. Here, four formulae are compared, from Heller and Barnes (2013), Henning, O'Connell and Sasselov (2009), Jackson, Barnes and Greenberg (2008), and Greenberg (2007), with additional information from Carone and Pätzold (2007) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (2014b, 2014c), along with the authors' estimates of the remaining parameters (see Appendix A). It was found that the calculated tidal energy was all of the same order of magnitude, indicating that all models are fairly good. However, the model by Heller and Barnes (2013) gave the value closest to the 6TW figure calculated by Greenberg (2007) by scaling Europa's physical and orbital parameters to those of Io, for which the tidal heating has been estimated through measurement. Thus, the model by Heller and Barnes (2013) was selected:
