  Natural elements serve as the building blocks of ecosystems, and cycle through the biosphere. Nitrogen is one of the most important elements for plant growth. To further increase plant growth, nitrogen is artificially added to ecosystems as fertilizer, though it may put nearby organisms at risk. The impact of fertilizer runoff affects many environments and the organisms that inhabit them. For these reasons, it is important to understand the effects of increased amounts of nitrogen on plant-animal interactions. To do so, we studied the effect of varying ammonium nitrate (AN) concentrations, a compound commonly found in fertilizer, on the interaction between *Arabidopsis thaliana* and *Myzus persicae*. The control group *A. thaliana* plants were treated with water, while low and high dose groups were treated with varying concentrations of AN. We counted the number of *M. persicae* present on each *A. thaliana* plant throughout the study period. The low dose group begins to plateau after the sixth day, while the control and high dose groups grew. These results suggest that soil nitrogen content affects trophic interactions between plants and herbivores. The optimal treatment was a low dose of AN, as population growth of *M. persicae* plateaued, limiting herbivory and potentially benefiting *A. thaliana*.
