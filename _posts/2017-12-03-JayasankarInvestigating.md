  Women’s artistic gymnastics is one of the most popular spectator sports at the Olympic Games. Artistic gymnasts compete in two streams–elite, regulated at the international level with ~40 hours/week of training and interclub, regulated at the national level with ~20 hours/ week of training.  Noticeable physical features of gymnasts include short stature and short limbs. Height data of gymnasts from the 2012 Olympic Games, 2016 Olympic Games, and 2016 NCAA Gymnastics Championships were collected and analyzed to determine whether elite gymnasts were significantly shorter than interclub and non-gymnast counterparts. Elite gymnasts at both Olympic Games were significantly shorter than interclub gymnasts at the NCAA Championships (p<0.0001). Additionally, gymnasts from each nation were significantly shorter than the national average height from females (p<0.05). Furthermore, a literature review analyzed physiological and osteological mechanisms behind the differences in stature. Female gymnasts show reduced levels of 17-β-estradiol, luteinizing hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), critical growth hormones in female development. High prevalence of growth plate injuries in the olecranal, patellar and tarsal regions of gymnasts suggest a potential mechanism for shortened limbs in gymnasts. Height data of gymnasts who competed at both the 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games determined that more than 50% of returning competitors displayed growth, and gymnasts who took a lengthy (1+ year) break from gymnastics demonstrated growth.
