  Invasion ecology explores the impacts of new species entering established ecological niches and communities. While the effects of invasive species are frequently discussed in both industry and academia, the definition of invasion remains vague, arbitrary, and based on human perception. The objective of this project was to better define species invasion using a mechanistic, stage-based perspective. Several authors have attempted to develop a definition that focuses on the process of invasion, rather than on the characteristics of the (potentially) invasive species. This process encompasses three main stages: transport, establishment, and spread. The purpose of a stage-based definition is to classify a given species by its progression through the invasion process. By integrating existing definitions, we propose a novel version of the stage-based process of invasion. This approach incorporates extrinsic factors such as competition, predation, and parasitism in addition to contingent physical forces such as flooding, freezing, and fire. Therefore, a wide variety of species will be able to fit into this definition. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we test our definition with an agent-based model that simulates the influence of multiple ecological factors (propagule pressure, resource availability, energy consumption, reproductive capability), which can either inhibit or assist the invasion of a species. Adopting a more comprehensive method for defining invasive species will allow for better communication within invasion ecology research and throughout the scientific community. Ultimately, our definition helps to simplify the process of developing a practical invasion prevention policy that can be implemented at multiple stages for full effectiveness.Â
