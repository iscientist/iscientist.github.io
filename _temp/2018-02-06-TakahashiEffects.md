  Road salt is often used during the winter months as a cheap and efficient way to melt snow. However, it also poses some serious environmental issues. Runoff containing road salt can lead to soil salinization, which can impact plant health. This has detrimental effects on not only the organisms that feed on these plants, but also on the surrounding ecosystem. The purpose of this experiment was to study how salinity affects plants and the herbivores that feed on them. Wild type Arabidopsis thaliana plants and Myzus persicae (green peach aphid) were the model organisms used in the experiment. It was hypothesized that watering the plants with different concentrations of saline solutions would affect the health and growth of the plants as well as the M. persicae populations. Wild type A. thaliana plants were inoculated with M. persicae and watered with either regular tap water, a 20 mM saline solution, or a 60 mM saline solution. Rosette leaf surface area and aphid population were recorded for each plant over the course of the experiment and analyzed to determine the effect of salinized water on A. thaliana and M. persicae. The saline treatments did not have a significant effect on the aphid population growth, but did significantly affect the leaf surface area. There was no significant difference between the control and the high salt treatments or the control and low salt treatments. However, statistical significance was found between the low and high salt treatments, suggesting that salt did have some effect on plant fitness. The lack of effect on the aphids could be due to two main reasons. Firstly, the plant may have allocated its resources towards survival rather than defence against the aphids. Secondly, the regions of the plant preferred by the aphids may not have been affected by the saline solution. Since the aphids do not appear to be affected by salinization, plants will have to face the double burden of salt stress and herbivory.

## Introduction

Road salt is one of the most widely-used environmental pollutants in Canada since it is a cheap and efficient way to melt snow and ice during the winter months. Road salt is usually made up of sodium chloride, and when used to de-ice roads and sidewalks, it significantly increases the concentrations of sodium in bodies of freshwater in North America (Godwin, Hafner and Buff, 2003). Moreover, studies have shown that the increase in sodium concentration has led to groundwater contamination and plant toxicity issues (Forman and Alexander, 1998). Increasing soil salinity also has detrimental effects to plant health, affecting the plant’s ability to uptake water and photosynthesize (Bryson and Barker, 2002). Consequently, it is important to study the impacts high salinity would have on not only the plants, but also on the ecosystem that the plants inhabit. While the negative effects of sodium on plant species may cause noticeable changes in plant health, any influence on the rest of the ecosystem and other species may be less apparent.

Although population size is regulated through both top-down and bottom-up interactions, the influence of either varies in each population. A discussion in the American Naturalist argues that community structure is controlled by bottom-up interactions, meaning every trophic level is “food-limited” (Hairston, Smith and Slobodkin, 1960). It is also argued that community structure is regulated by top-down interactions, whereby each trophic level limits the population size of the trophic level below it (Hillebrand, et al., 2007). In a community that operates via bottom-up interactions, an increase in soil salinity would likely negatively impact the rest of the ecosystem, which depends upon the affected plant species for energy. The influence of the salt would be seen first within the primary producers and then within herbivore populations such as insects. Any impact on the size of these insect populations would be sure to have repercussions elsewhere in the food chain. Therefore, it is important to determine whether road salt influences plant growth and the effect this has on herbivores.

To address this issue, a 13-day experiment was designed to observe the interactions between the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana and one of its predators, Myzus persicae, more commonly known as the green peach aphid. The study was conducted in order to answer the following set of questions: (1) is the growth rate of A. thaliana affected by an increase of soil salinity, and (2) how does the concentration of salinity affect the size and growth of the M. persicae populations feeding on A. thaliana?

Watering the A. thaliana plants with salinized water was predicted to cause decreased plant growth and a reduction in aphid population size for several reasons. Continual high salinity in plants results in the cessation of plant leaf surface expansion, a decrease in the productivity of photosynthesis, and plant death (Parida and Das, 2005). This causes aphid populations, which rely on the phloem sap of plants for nutrition (Giordanengo, et al., 2010), to be left without a food source. Additionally, high salinity in plants increases plant mesophyll and epidermal thickness (Boughalleb, Denden and Tiba, 2009). This may make it more difficult for the aphids to pierce the leaves for food (Giordanengo, et al., 2010).

By observing the effect of saline soil on A. thaliana and M. persicae, the present study aims to better understand the effects of road de-icing on primary producers and the organisms that feed on them. The results of the study may have important implications for the future of ecosystems both around Cootes Paradise and around the world.

## Materials and Methods

### Experimental Design

For the experiment, 24 healthy wild type A. thaliana rosettes were chosen out of a selection of plants grown in the McMaster University Greenhouse in Hamilton. These plants were deemed healthy based on their lack of discolouration or torn leaves. All chosen plants either had not begun the bolting stage or had bolts that had been previously removed. The study used 96 viviparous female M. persicae (green peach aphid) that had been reared on either A. thaliana or tobacco leaves.

### Randomization of Treatments

In order to randomize the treatment that each plant would receive, a random number table was used (Petrie and Sabin, 2009). Each plant was assigned a letter from A to X as an identifier and a four-number range. Since a random number table was used and there were more than 10 plants, a range of numbers that went up to 100 was required. To make the randomization process more efficient, a four-number range was chosen for each plant. For example, numbers one to four corresponded to plant A, numbers five to eight corresponded to plant B, etcetera (Table 1). The random number table was then used to assign treatments to plants in the systematic pattern of “no salt”, “low salt”, and “high salt”. If the number from the random number table corresponded to a plant that had already been given a treatment, the number was disregarded. This pattern was continued until all the plants had been assigned a treatment, resulting in eight plants per treatment.

This random number table was used again to determine the placement of the plants in the two trays. The sequence of two-digit numbers in the table dictated the order in which plants were placed in the tray. Plants were placed one at a time into Tray 1, first filling up a row of three and then going on to the next until there were four rows of three plants each. Tray 2 was filled in the same manner (Figure 1). Plants were arranged in a staggered fashion to minimize the contact between plants and to reduce the chance of aphids migrating between plants.
